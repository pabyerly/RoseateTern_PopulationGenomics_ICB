# RoseateTern_PopulationGenomics_ICB
SNP fastqfiles and data analysis scripts for genomic analysis of population structuring in historical and modern Roseate Tern (Sterna dougallii) populations in the Western Atlantic. Next-generation sequencing approaches (including capture of Ultra-conserved Elements) were used generate genome-wide data for the purposes of evaluating historical and current gene flow among roseate tern populations in the Atlantic Basin. These data will allow us to investigate changes to population processes that may have resulted from human-mediated population declines in the 20th century. Results from this research will also be used to make comparisons between historical and current population parameters, including genetic diversity, which will contribute to understanding of the long-term effects of fragmentation on highly mobile wildlife species, and will be used for future conservation planning.
